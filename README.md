Project of database course at 2nd year. 

A front-end project based on Apache linux, the aim is a user-friendly web interface to manipulate a database.

Functions:
- sign in/out
- retrieve/delete/add data
- search
- data back up
- data recovery
- resistence to simple sql-injections
- access control
- and some functions are not completed yet ...

Before working on this project I had almost no knowledge about front-end programming and it was finished somehow in a hurry. the method of complementing some funcitons may be very weird.
